      "description": "In the center of the action with 360-degree views of the city skyline and an outdoor pool, the non-smoking Baltimore Harbor Hotel is a smart choice for Priceline guests. The 27-story tower houses 323 non-smoking rooms with high ceilings, desks with ample lighting and high-end ergonomic chairs, free Wi-Fi and wired internet connections and flat-panel HDTVs that you can enjoy while lounging on pillowtop beds. A free continental breakfast is served daily. The seasonal outdoor pool and sun deck, open during the summer months, are a hit with kids. There's also a roomy fitness center where the cardio machines have great vistas through floor-to-ceiling windows. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel, including the Inner Harbor, National Aquarium, 1st Mariner Arena, the Baltimore Convention Center and Johns Hopkins University. Plenty of dining options are just outside the front door. Amtrak's Penn Station is a mile north, and Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport is 10 miles south. Baltimore Harbor Hotel also boasts a central location and a host of convenient amenities. ",
